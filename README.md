**AUTOMATIC RAIN PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR CLOTHES DRYING RACKS**
 

                             **RAINGUARDIA**



### **1. Introduction:**
Drying clothes outside is a common practice for many households, but sudden rain can cause inconvenience by soaking the clothes, leading to prolonged drying times, unpleasant odors, and potential bacterial growth.

Outdoor drying racks, while cost-effective and energy-efficient, are dependent on favorable weather conditions. Many people lack the time or resources to monitor weather changes continuously, making unexpected rainfall a significant problem. The issue is even more prominent in urban areas where space constraints limit indoor drying options.

Our solution addresses this problem by automating rain protection for drying clothes, ensuring convenience and reliability.

### **2. Objective:**
To design and implement a motorized system equipped with a water-resistant bellow cover that automatically extends over the drying rack upon detecting rain, ensuring protection and convenience for domestic users.

---

### **3. Problem Statement:**
Drying clothes outdoors is essential but often interrupted by unexpected rain, causing the following issues:
- Extended drying times.
- Development of unpleasant odors due to moisture retention.
- Increased manual effort in moving clothes indoors.
- Potential bacterial growth leading to hygiene concerns.

A practical and automated solution is needed to protect outdoor drying clothes from rain while ensuring ease of use.

### **4. Scope of the Problem:**
- **Widespread Practice:** Outdoor drying is common due to its low cost and convenience.
- **Health Concerns:** Wet clothes can harbor bacteria and fungi, posing hygiene risks.
- **Economic Impact:** Increased dependency on electric dryers leads to higher energy costs.
- **Environmental Impact:** Excessive use of electric dryers contributes to carbon emissions.
- **Daily Inconvenience:** Sudden rain disrupts daily routines and causes frustration.
